# 🪙 AI Crypto Agent: The Knowledge-First 3D Experience

## 📖 Project Overview

The **AI Crypto Agent** is a specialized, high-integrity conversational assistant designed to provide accurate, factual information about cryptocurrencies. It is an immersive experiment in **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** principles, featuring a stunning 3D user interface.

Built upon a strict **"Knowledge-First" architecture**, the agent prioritizes verified local data and real-time market metrics over generative speculation. Its core mission is to bridge the gap between institutional accuracy and an engaging, modern user experience.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The application is built on a high-performance hybrid infrastructure:

1.  **FastAPI Backend:** A robust Python API that coordinates entity resolution, intent detection, and real-time data fetching.
2.  **3D Frontend Experience:** A sophisticated web interface built with **Three.js**, **GSAP**, and Vanilla Javascript. It features an interactive 3D particle environment, glassmorphism design, and smooth transitions.
3.  **Local Knowledge Base:** A curated repository of crypto metadata ensuring hallucination-free responses for historical and foundational facts.
4.  **Real-Time API Layer:** Seamless integration with **CoinGecko** for live price tracking and market updates.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🛡️ Strict Hallucination Guards
The agent uses intent detection to strictly stick to facts. It is programmed to refuse financial advice or speculative predictions, maintaining the highest standards of informational integrity.

### 🌐 Immersive 3D Dashboard
- **Three.js Environment:** Interactive 3D space with floating particle systems.
- **Dynamic AI "Thinking":** Realistic status indicators ("Analyzing...", "Generating...") with smooth typewriter effects.
- **Glassmorphism UI:** Modern, translucent panels that provide a "premium feel."
- **Integrated Visuals:** Responses include coin icons and subtle background watermarks for instant visual recognition.

### ⚡ Real-Time Market Data
Ask for the price of BTC, ETH, SOL, and more to get live, timestamped data directly in your chat bubble.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Backend:** Python 3.8+, FastAPI, Uvicorn
